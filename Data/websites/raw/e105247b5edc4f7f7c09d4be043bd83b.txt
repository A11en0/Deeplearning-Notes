</div>
<div class="wikitext"><p>Suppose, <a href="/~cks/space/blog/tech/PCIeSlotsLimitations">not hypothetically</a>, that
you want to understand the PCIe slot and bus topology of your Linux
system and also work out how many PCIe lanes important things have
been given. Sometimes the PCIe lane count doesn't matter, but things
like NVMe drives may have lower latency under load and perform
better if they get their full number of PCIe lanes (generally four
lanes, 'x4'). You can do this under Linux, but it's not as
straightforward as you'd like.</p>

<p>The easiest way to see PCIe topology is with '<code>lspci -tv</code>', which
shows you how PCIe slots relate to each other and also what's in
them. On <a href="/~cks/space/blog/linux/WorkMachine2017">my office machine</a> with the first
configuration of PCIE to NVMe adapter card, this looked like the
following:</p>

<p>(By the way, the PCIe numbers shown here have no resemblance to the
numbers in the output of plain '<code>lspci</code>'. Also, I have left out the
text for a lot of 'PCIe Dummy Host Bridge' devices and a couple of
others.)</p>

<p>The two Kingston PCIe devices are the two NVMe drives. The first
one listed is in the motherboard M.2 slot; the second one listed
is on its adapter card in a PCIe x16 @ x4 slot driven by the X370
chipset instead of directly by the CPU. Although it's not obvious
from the topology listing, one of the Intel Ethernets is on the
motherboard (but driven through the X370 chipset) and the other is
a card in a PCIe x1 slot.</p>

<p>Now here's the same machine with the PCIe adapter for the second
NVMe drive moved to a PCIe x16 @ x8 GPU card slot:</p>

<p>It's pretty clear that the second NVMe drive has shifted its position
in the topology fairly significantly, and given that we have '03.1' and
'03.2' labels for the Radeon GPU and the NVMe drive, it's not hard to
guess that it's now in one of a pair of GPU slots. It's also clearly no
longer under the X370 chipset, but instead is now on the same (PCIe)
level as the first NVMe drive.</p>

<p>Working out how many PCIe lanes a card wants and how many it's
actually getting is harder and more annoying. As far as I know,
the best way of finding it out is to look carefully through the
output of '<code>lspci -vv</code>' for the device you're interested in and
focus on the <code>LnkCap</code> and <code>LnkSta</code> portions, which will list what
the card is capable of and what it actually got. For example, for
my PCIe to NVMe adapter card in its first location (the first
topology), where it was choked down from PCIe x4 to x2, this
looks like the following:</p>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
04:00.0 Non-Volatile memory controller: Kingston Technology Company, Inc. Device 2263 (rev 03) (prog-if 02 [NVM Express])
 [...]
   LnkCap: Port #0, Speed 8GT/s, Width x4, ASPM L1, Exit Latency L1 &lt;8us
           ClockPM+ Surprise- LLActRep- BwNot- ASPMOptComp+
 [...]
   LnkSta: Speed 5GT/s (downgraded), Width x2 (downgraded)
           TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt-
 [...]
</pre>

<p>This says that it could do PCIe x4 at 8GT/s (which is PCIe 3.0) but
was downgraded to PCIe x2 at 5GT/s (which is PCIe 2.0). In the PCIe
adapter's new location in a GPU card slot where the NVMe drive could
get full speed, the <code>LnkCap</code> didn't change but the <code>LnkSta</code> changed
to:</p>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
   LnkSta: Speed 8GT/s (ok), Width x4 (ok)
           TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt-
</pre>

<p>So now the NVMe drive is getting x4 PCIE 3.0.</p>

<p>In general, searching '<code>lspci -vv</code>' output for 'downgraded' can be
interesting. For example, on <a href="/~cks/space/blog/linux/WorkMachine2017">my office machine</a>, the Radeon GPU
reports the following in both PCIe topologies:</p>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
0a:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Lexa PRO [Radeon 540/540X/550/550X / RX 540X/550/550X] (rev c7) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
 [...]
   LnkCap: Port #1, Speed 8GT/s, Width x8, ASPM L1, Exit Latency L1 &lt;1us
           ClockPM- Surprise- LLActRep- BwNot- ASPMOptComp+
 [...]
   LnkSta: Speed 2.5GT/s (downgraded), Width x8 (ok)
           TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt-
 [...]
</pre>

<p>I have no idea why the Radeon GPU has apparently been downgraded
from PCIe 3.0 all the way to what looks like PCIe 1.0, although it
may be because it's probably behind a 'PCIe GPP Bridge' that has
also been downgraded to 2.5 GT/s. Perhaps I've missed some BIOS
setting that is affecting things (BIOS settings can apparently
influence this part of PCIe, as they do many bits of it). For my
relatively basic X usage, this downgrade may not matter, but having
noticed it I'm now curious and somewhat irritated.  If my card can
do PCIe 3.0, I want to be getting PCIe 3.0 if at all possible.</p>

next time I need to poke around in this area.)</p>
