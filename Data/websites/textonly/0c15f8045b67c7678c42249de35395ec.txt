Linux: protecting configuration files
Dennis Zimmer
No matter if you’re running a linux environment on premise or in a cloud instance using any distribution (i. e. Ubuntu, Centos, RHEL or something else), you want to know if something has been touched.
CodeNotary allows you exactly that in the most simple way and the verification counterpart is even stored safely outside of your environment.
The following blog post covers the notarization of the /etc directory where configuration files are typically stored and the automatic authentication whenever you log in.
Install vcn
Notarize file or folder
change your bash profile to authenticate whenever logging in
some example
Install vcn
There are plenty of different ways to install the vcn Command line tool. And of course you can build it yourself. The GitHub repository can be found here:
https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn
and the latest release:
https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/releases/latest
If you want a quick installation (Linux, MacOS), you can also use our installation script:
bash <(curl http://getvcn.codenotary.io -L)
Notarize file or folder
As vcn is installed and running we can notarize the folder or files we like to verify everytime we log in. These could be:
configuration files (Apache, NGINX, Firewall services, Sudoers files and much more)
folders containing configuration files
file or folders that should never change unnoticed
CodeNotary 
The notarization of the /etc folder
vcn a dir:///etc
 vcn n /path/file 
Change your bash profile to authenticate whenever logging in
Instead of authenticate or verify the configuration folder /etc everytime we log in, we want to do that in an automatic way. This example is simple but could be enhanced very easily to secure the environment even more.
nano ~/.profile
CHECKSUM=$(sha256sum /usr/local/bin/vcn | cut -d " " -f 1) 
curl -s https://api.codenotary.io/authenticate/$CHECKSUM?org=vchain.us | grep -q :0 
Save the file and the next login is already checking the /etc folder.
Some example
Nothing changed since the notarization took place:
After changing the /etc/sudoers file
As you could see its so easy and straightforward to use CodeNotary to protect your directories or folders. That works for Linux, MacOS and of course Windows as well (we’re covering Microsoft Windows another time).
