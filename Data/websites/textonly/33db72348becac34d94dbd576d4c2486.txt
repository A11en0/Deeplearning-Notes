GTK_FRAME_EXTENTS_
It‚Äôs almost native-looking! And it fits right in with the rest of your apps.
working hard on this for months
But wait, there‚Äôs more‚Ä¶
More New Features
can now show or hide the background frame when placed on the desktop
now supports WPA3 encryption
Bugfixes & Performance Improvements
text you enter no longer automatically becomes double-quoted
could cause the ‚ÄúOpen Containing Folder‚Äù feature to fail to launch Dolphin after the first time it was used
now automatically strips out ‚Äúfile://‚Äù when pasting local URLs
no longer appears in the top-left corner of the screen after you suspend compositing and restart KWin while an app that displays a System Tray icon is running
no longer becomes outrageously gigantic when the media title is really really long
now has a better default size and margins
the ‚Äúno weather stations found‚Äù text no longer overflows the view
the windows are restored stacked in the order they were minimized rather than semi-randomly
no longer unexpectedly changes its appearance when hovering over a GTK app by default
no longer displays almost-invisible icons when using a dark plasma theme but a light apps color scheme
compiling the Keyboard KCM in plasma-desktop is now much faster and no longer brings your system to its knees with a recursive forkbomb
now match the background color of the frame when using many non-default color schemes
Fixed the margins on a variety of standalone dialog and assistant windows
User Interface Improvements
is now a real toolbar that doesn‚Äôt scroll away
re-implemented it in a better way.
Task progress sheet now looks like it‚Äôs supposed to
now move out of the way rather than disappearing when the System Tray popup is open in the same area
http://s1.webmshare.com/MxLLd.webm
is now framed in a circle, just like on the lock and login screens

This is looking great. Every week I see KDE getting better and better and I still question how it bypasses my expectations each time.

								December 1, 2019 at 12:11 pm							
I know how you feel. üôÇ

								December 7, 2019 at 8:38 am							
That‚Äôs a huge improvement, as in the current state a GTK window above another window with the same background color cannot be distinguished from one another. üôÇ Good job!!!

This bug report still says ‚Äúreported‚Äù only?

Just..wow. Plasma 5.18 IS ‚Äúthe year of the linux desktop‚Äù, for sure. It‚Äôs very satisfying to be able to follow the progress easily here on your site, Nate, thanks a lot. Also it‚Äôs very reassuring to know that there are so many talented people working together on things big and small to continuously make KDE better. It really does make a difference while choosing a desktop/distro when you know that there‚Äôs more than one or two people doing everything and there‚Äôs a risk they just give up one day, and that you can reach out easily to someone that can help with any issue that you may encounter. This is all just great, enjoyable fun, very cool and excuse my French: GODDAMN FANTASTIC! I thank you, my computers thank you and come Plasma 5.18 all my friends/familys computers (old and new) will thank you as well.

								December 1, 2019 at 12:15 pm							
I feel similarly. One-man projects or very small teams are always a bit disconcerting. But KDE‚Äôs developer community is humongous! The pace of improvement is pretty amazing. Believe it or not, sometimes I get a bit frustrated that it isn‚Äôt even faster! There are so many cool things in the pipeline that are like 80%+ done. But that‚Äôs the way all projects are, ultimately. the old 80/20 rule strikes again!

								December 1, 2019 at 4:34 am							
> The weather widget‚Äôs weather station configuration window now has a better default size and margins, and the ‚Äúno weather stations found‚Äù text no longer overflows the view (me: Nate Graham, Plasma 5.17.4):
Is it a bug that there are alternating row colors displayed in the screenshot, although no items were found?

								December 1, 2019 at 12:16 pm							
Yeah, that‚Äôs a minor visual bug. I‚Äôll fix it once I port the QtQuickControls1 table view to be a QtQuickControls2 list view.

								December 1, 2019 at 4:34 am							
Wow! This is amazing!
Thank you Nate for informing us about everything in KDE, and a big thank you to all contributors of KDE.
Best thing about KDE: It‚Äôs build by users, for users!

								December 1, 2019 at 12:16 pm							
You‚Äôre very welcome!

								December 1, 2019 at 5:48 am							
This is excellent. So now Firefox will look like a native application on KDE Plasma.

Great improvements, especially GTK one seems like will be a great quality of life improvement.

And will the GTK-based and Electron-based apps open ther KDE dialog instead of that old-fashioned GTK dialog?

								December 1, 2019 at 12:22 pm							
It‚Äôs up to the apps themselves to either hook into KIO directly (as LibreOffice does) or use the GTKFilePickerNative API and force the use of XDG desktop portals when in a Plasma environment (as Firefox and Thunderbird and many GNOME apps do). But there‚Äôs nothing we can do on the KDE side to force this.
Please file bugs against apps that use the GTK file dialog when run on Plasma!

I have a question about GTK CSDs and their behavior logic.
What will happen when the titlebar is stripped (by latte or some script)? This is a typical option for global menus and maximized windows. Stripping titlebar ensures that there is no redundant stripe since all functionality is moved to upper panel (buttons, appmenu, titles plus other panel‚Äôs elements).
I assume that the CSD will be exempt from that stripping. Unless latte developer will do his magic and creates another widget that will move CSD functionality into panel‚Ä¶ All is possible üòâ
Anyway, what about the buttons and title? This could create doubled elements, so I‚Äôm curious if the new option already has a solution for global menu with upper panel setup behavior? I know that this isn‚Äôt the official available setup but maybe the new CSD option included option for it? If not, it will be brought to the table by many users so it‚Äôs better to think of it before the official release.
I kinda enjoy the idea about the additional widget with CSD buttons where we could tweak, turn on/off certain elements but is there any space for that on a panel? It‚Äôs already pretty filled with buttons, title, menu, system tray, clock and few additional widgets (like for weather).
In general, I think it‚Äôs a good idea to support officially CSDs. Plasma always has been inclusive, even if some elements weren‚Äôt native to it and that is why it makes it so powerful. One DE that rules them all ;D.

								December 1, 2019 at 12:25 pm							
CSD apps have no titlebar to strip. I imagine that titlebar-stripping apps will just ignore these windows. I *think* it would be technically possible to remove the close/minimize/maximize buttons from the headerbar when it‚Äôs maximized as we do have a hook into their ordering and visibility. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs been implemented yet though. Our next thing is going to be trying to make order and visiblity of those buttons in CSD headerbar apps respect the settings you‚Äôre using for SSD apps.

Great stuff! Regarding ‚ÄúVisible notifications now move out of the way rather than disappearing when the System Tray popup is open in the same area‚Äù: 1. the video doesn‚Äôt play on Firefox for Android even though the play/pause button toggles and the progress indicators animate. 2. In Fedora the notification about ‚Äú17 updates available‚Äù obscures the Plasma pop-up behind it with the details of the packages and the button to update; will this fix address that usability glitch?

								December 2, 2019 at 5:11 pm							
Yes, it does.

								December 3, 2019 at 11:19 am							
hello Nate, I noticed that a while ago you switched off windows borders. Now I cannot distinguish the edge of a window overlapping another window. That is not very handy. It this a temporary situation? Thanks! John

								December 3, 2019 at 12:06 pm							
That‚Äôs what the window shadows are for. Have you turned them off?

								December 5, 2019 at 1:46 am							
Anyway, my GUI system is much more usable with shadows!
(*) I always use the default settings due to this reasoning: Don‚Äôt trust my system otherwise since I feel it is impossible for developers to test all scenario‚Äôs (Exponential increase of complexity / all combinations).

								December 5, 2019 at 8:38 am							
Glad you got it working! I guess your graphics hardware is somehow subtly incompatible with OpenGL 2.0.
The System Settings crash should be fixed in the next Frameworks release (coming out in two days).

								December 3, 2019 at 1:10 pm							
A lot of these posts have window decorations without the white circle in the close button. That looks so much better, and yet I could never find where you can obtain that or an announcement for a system-wide theme change. Could you explain it to me?

								December 3, 2019 at 2:47 pm							
System Settings > Application Style > Window Decorations > Breeze > Click on inline Edit button (it looks like a pencil) > Uncheck ‚ÄúDraw a circle around close button‚Äù

								December 5, 2019 at 10:23 am							
No way it‚Äôs that easy. Now for a way to transfer that to GTK‚Äôs CSD

								December 5, 2019 at 10:31 am							
That‚Äôs in progress too. üôÇ
