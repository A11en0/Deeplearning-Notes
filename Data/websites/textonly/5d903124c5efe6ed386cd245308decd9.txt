Yupp, as presented at AllSystemsGo! 2019, here it is! Should be pretty complete, with LUKS and fscrypt backends, with PKCS#11 yubikey unlocking, key suspending during system sleep, and lots and lots of other fancy features.

Also, looks like the systemd-homed and systemd-logind services timeout throughout the integration testsuite:

logind: honour per-user stopDelayUSec property

      

    
pam-systemd: port to pam_bus_log_{create|parse}_error() and pam_log_o…

      

    
pam-systemd: share bus connection with pam_systemd_home if we can

      

    
Let's use the pam-util.h provided helpers to acquire them.
pam-systemd: port over to use a UserRecord structure

      

    
Later on this allows us to set various session properties from user
record.
pam-systemd: normalize return values of append_session_xyz()

      

    
Let's propagate the PAM errors we got.
pam-systemd: apply user record properties to session

      

    
This way any component providing us with JSON user record data can use
this for automatic resource management and other session properties.
sleep: automatically lock all home directories when suspending

      

    
udev: mark all ccid/security devices with a special tag

      

    
This adds a udev tag that is supposed to be attached to all devices
that might potentially expose a PKCS#11 slot, i.e. CCID smartcards and
similar. We can then use the appearance of devices of this type as
trigger to rescan PKCS#11 slots.
cryptsetup: add native pkcs#11 support to cryptsetup

      

    
This adds a new crypttab option for volumes "pkcs11-uri=" which takes a
PKCS#11 URI. When used the key stored in the line's key file is
decrypted with the private key the PKCS#11 URI indiciates.

This means any smartcard that can store private RSA keys is usable for
unlocking LUKS devices.

man: document pam_systemd_home

      

    
man: document new pam_systemd features in man page

      

    
This also updates the suggested PAM snippet in a number of way:

1. Be closer to the logic nowadays implemented in Fedora where the
   auth/account/password stacks are all finished off with
   pam_{deny|permit}.so

2. Make pam_unix.so just "sufficient" instead of "required" (paving
   ground for pam_systemd_home.so being hooked in as additional
   sufficient module.

3. Only do pam_nologin in the "account" stack, since it's about account
   validity really.

4. Use modern parameters to pam_unix when changing passwords, i.e.
   sha512 and shadow, and use already set up passwords (preparing ground
   for pam_systemd_home again)

man: document the new nss-systemd behaviour

      

    
(This also changes the suggested /etc/nsswitch.conf line to use for
hooking up nss-system to use glibc's [SUCCESS=merge] feature so that we
can properly merge group membership lists).

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fscrypt.html
Since systemd-homed is new code, if you don't mind requiring kernel v5.4+ for fscrypt to be used with systemd-homed, you might want to consider supporting v2 encryption policies only.
Note that the other fscrypt maintainers and I aren't planning to add any new features to v1 encryption policies and the process-subscribed keyring based API for fscrypt.  They're maintained for backwards compatibility only.
It also looks like systemd-homed never "locks" the directory after it's been unlocked.  With the new FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY ioctl it would be easy to do
