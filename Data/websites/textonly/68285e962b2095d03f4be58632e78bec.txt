The Power of the XDG Base Directory Specification
I'm writing this article because I have the feeling that not many people know about this convention even if it exists for years and can lead to a very clear directory structure and file paths instead of a cluttered home directory with thousands of files.
ls -la | wc -l 
XDG Base Directory Specification to the rescue
The XDG Base Directory Specification is a widely used specification which specifies where your files should be located depending on their usage published by the freedesktop.org-organization. 
But what is freedesktop.org?
freedesktop.org, formerly known as X Desktop Group (XDG), is an organization which has many open source projects including the X Window System, Wayland or systemd.
What does the specification say?
They published a specification which mainly consists of three important points:
$XDG_DATA_HOME
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME
$XDG_CACHE_HOME
If these environment variables are not set, the specification says it should go in these directories:
$XDG_DATA_HOME
$HOME/.local/share
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME
$HOME/.config
$XDG_CACHE_HOME
$HOME/.cache
$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
$XDG_DATA_DIRS
Read environment variable or use fallback
Create a directory with your program name in this directory
Place your caching/data/configuration files there.
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/x
$HOME/.config/x
