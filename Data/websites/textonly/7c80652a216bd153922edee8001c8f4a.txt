Forwarding game controllers and other input over SSH
01 December 2019

input-over-ssh (legacy)
input-over-ssh
python-evdev
Then navigate to the root directory on the client and run:
python -m input_over_ssh.client -L

python -u -m input_over_ssh.client -p /dev/input/event1 | ssh hostname.example.com 'PYTHONPATH=/path/to/input-over-ssh python -m input_over_ssh.server'

For the adventurous, you ought to be able to replace ssh with netcat/socat over UDP to further reduce latency.
In combination with a VNC server/client setup, this could be used as a open-source alternative to services like Steam Remote Play.
