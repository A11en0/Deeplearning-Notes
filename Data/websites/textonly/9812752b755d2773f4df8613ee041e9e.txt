Dept of Spec ð
Here's your news for what happened in spec-land last week!
Merged MSCs
MSC2367: Add reason field to all membership events
MSC2324: Facilitating early releases of software dependent on spec
MSCs in Final Comment Period
No MSCs are in FCP...
MSC2380: Matrix Media Information API
MSC2370: Resolve URL API
MSC2375: Appservice Invite States
MSC2376: Disable URL Previews
TravisR confirmed:
The spec core team is focused on implementing a bunch of MSCs so that we can make progress with the spec.
Dept of Servers ð¢
This week we've mainly been tying up loose ends on the matrix.org data centre migration. Outside of that one interesting feature to land on develop is that of configurable message retention. It means that as an admin you can set a default period after which messages will be removed from the server (a year say), whatâs more the default is configurable on a per room basis via state events. Note, this feature applies to messages only, not media (on its way!). Configurable message retention will be make it into the next versioned release.

RiotX 0.9.1
Released v0.9.1 on Thursday! This version includes a new login flow and account creation flow. Read marker has been reworked, to simplify user experience on mobile. Also you can type and send user pills.
We are now working on room and user profiles, and matrix.to link handling. Verification in DM development is progressing well. Also we implemented a first version of breadcrumbs, to switch between recent rooms very quickly.
Riot-iOS 0.10.3 is on its way to Apple review. The release note is:
This release includes bug fixes and improvements, like:
Ask permission before opening a widget and the integration manager.
Display room name, user name and user avatar in the Jitsi conference screen.
Support Welsh and Italian languages.
https://github.com/manuroe/messagerie
Messagerie is a chat app written to test SwiftUI and Combine to make a real and, hopefully, useful app.
Messagerie misses a lot of things but it has:
Support of Matrix using SwiftMatrixSDK
Multi-account (swipe the navigation bar to switch accounts)
Dark mode and auto-sizing fonts (well, they come for free)
4 screens at the moment: a Matrix login screen, a room list, a room screen and a very early beginning of a SwiftUI text composer to post text message
This is a personal and a side project, but RiotX-iOS will probably take benefit from it.
Riot Web means Cross Signing!
Riot Web is largely focused on nudging cross-signing forward over the last week. Key verification and cross-signing setup continues to make progress. We've also fixed a few bugs and merged some accessibility improvements.

not posting the same links multiple times
not posting a link when you've already linked the msc in the original message
