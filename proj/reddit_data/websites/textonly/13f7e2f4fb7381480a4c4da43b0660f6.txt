Whatâs in a Name andÂ Number?
We detailed our shift in the numbering scheme from the 0.x of old to Juno being elementary OS 5 when we announced it back in October. In the same vein, Hera builds on the new numbering scheme.
Hera is the culmination of our work over the past year packaged up into one cohesive update.
elementary OS 5.1 Hera takes the same foundation as Junoâutilizing the same underlying repositories and librariesâbut builds on it with a refined experience. It is the culmination of our work over the past year packaged up into one cohesive update. As such, the 5.1 number represents that itâs a major update, but not an entirely new version (which usually come around every two years). Itâs still significant enough, however, to deserve its own name and identity.
We always name our releases after mythological beings and deities, and Hera is no different. The Greek equivalent of Juno, Hera is considered the queen of the Greek gods and represents women, marriage, family, and childbirth.

Greeter & Onboarding
This is the duo of major new features for Hera, and greatly improves the first-run experience for users.

The newly redesigned login and lockscreen greeter looks sharper, works better, and fixes many reported issues with the previous greeter including focus issues, HiDPI issues, and better localization.
The new design in Hera was in response to user feedback from Juno, and enables some nice new features. It now always shows usernames for all users, shows usersâ backgrounds as cards so you can more easily find users who maybe havenât set differentiating avatars, notifies when Caps or Num Lock are on, and makes âLog In as Guestâ more distinct when itâs enabled.

 Get Settled into elementary OS with Onboarding




 Designed to improve the first-run experience

Together, these two components greatly improve the first impressions of elementary OS from first run or getting a new computer all the way through using your account for the first time. With a fresh codebase across both, weâll also be able to more quickly iterate on features and fixes.
a Flatpak future for our AppCenter ecosystem
While we always recommend installing curated AppCenter apps where weâve done extensive automated and human reviews, we understand that some apps will not meet the strict requirements for AppCenterâand will thus be distributed elsewhere. Rather than encouraging users to drop to a Terminal, add inherently insecure PPAs, or install packages that end up getting root access to the system, weâve created a new core elementary OS utility called Sideload to make it extremely easy to sideload Flatpak apps.
The new Sideload app
Sideload explains the implications of installing an app including potential download size and if it will add a remote that might contain other apps.
the center of our platform
First, AppCenter is up to 10Ã faster in Hera, loading the homepage and featured apps blazingly fast. Weâve also improved performance throughout the app and do more tasks in parallel, leading to lower memory usage and an all-around faster experience.
On app listings, weâve added a loading animation to screenshots, plus added new forward/back navigation buttons on hover in case the little dots were too hard to hit. App listings now support choosing between different app sources if the same app is provided by multiple remotes. AppCenter in Hera also works much better when your device is offline; you can continue to browse cached apps and uninstall existing apps without a network connection.
New & Improved AppCenter categories
all AppCenter apps released so far for Juno will automatically be available in Hera
Accessibility and SystemÂ Settings
shared our philosophy on accessibility features
Improved Sound settings
Sound settings have been improved with a new approach to handling external devices. The result is a simpler way of picking your output device and the more reliable display of available devices. Weâve also added the âFlash screenâ option for event alerts here to better manage whether alerts are audible, visual, both, or neither. This is particularly handy for the hearing impaired or to use in environments where an audible alert would be inappropriate, like live production.
Improved Mouse & TouchpadÂ settings
Mouse & Touchpad settings have been redesigned and improved for Hera. Theyâre now organized into sections for different behavior- and hardware-specific settings, plus several accessibility settings like long-press secondary click, reveal pointer, double-click speed, and control pointer using keypad have been exposed. Weâve also added the highly-requested âIgnore when mouse is connectedâ toggle to the touchpad settings, and fixed the middle-click setting not appearing in certain situations.
New Desktop Appearance settings
Weâve added a new Appearance tab to the Desktop settings, exposing some existing accessibility settings and making them more discoverable. This includes a new wider range of supported text sizes, from small (0.75Ã) to larger (1.5Ã). This should help those who need larger or smaller text, including alleviating some issues with certain hardware combinations where 1Ã or 2Ã display scaling is not the best fit.
Over in the Wallpaper page, weâve fixed reported issues with setting wallpapers on the Login and Lock screen.
Improved Displays settings
The Displays settings have been improved, bringing a more reliable scaling factor setting, new refresh rate options, and an improved design using palette colors. Display moving, snapping, and aligning has also been reworked, making it much easier and less error-prone to align displays to match their physical orientation.
Improved Bluetooth settings with a pairing agent for PINs and passkeys
Bluetooth settings have been improved with more reliable pairing and trusting of devices, plus a new pairing agent to better handle devices that need a PIN or passkey to pair. This dialog shows up when pairing a device like a keyboard, and increases the compatibility of elementary OS for more wireless devices.
Refined Date & Time settings
For Date & Time settings in Hera, weâve cleaned up the design and added an automatic timezone setting.
Improved Language & Region settings
Weâve improved Language & Region settings in Hera. Installing new languages has been moved to a dialog to make it cleaner and more straightforward, the sidebar updates the status of languages more accurately, and the settings now only prompt you to authenticate when you actually need toâleading to a cleaner design and avoiding stacked infobars.
Redesigned VPN and Hotspot settings
Heraâs Network settings have also been redesigned in a few places: the Hotspot settings are now in-page instead of in a separate dialog, and the new VPN page is much easier to use.
Reworked Housekeeping settings
We reworked the design of the Housekeeping settings in the Security & Privacy settings to better match the design of the new Onboarding app.
In Power settings, weâve added a new âPrompt to shutdownâ option for the power button alongside the existing âDo nothingâ and âSuspendâ options. When chosen, pressing a physical power button on your device will show the standard Shut Down dialog which can be handy as a safeguard against accidental shut downs.
Improved Applications Menu search
Lastly, weâve made both System Settings and system actions like restarting much more discoverable in Hera with greatly improved deep searching from the Applications Menu. You can now search for something like âdisplayâ and get a list of all the individual features in each pane where the word âdisplayâ is used. Weâve also updated those keywords across all actions and settings panes, making them even easier to findâincluding common alternatives like ârebootâ for Restart.
App Updates
As with any major elementary OS update, weâve been hard at work on several of the core apps for Hera.
Refreshed Calendar design
February updates story
Weâve updated the Camera app in Hera for greatly improved hardware compatibility and performance with cameras on several popular laptops, including many Dell models.
In Photos we now show a checkerboard background behind translucent image thumbnails. Weâve also worked to improve the UI of dialogs throughout the app.
Weâve spent a lot of time improving Music for Hera, with large improvements to sorting in the album, list, and column views.
New accent color in Music
We also made keyboard shortcuts more discoverable, plus added a new bold orange accent color throughout, carrying its identity from the icon into the app itself. We fixed several reported issues with queuing and playlists. Music can now also play s3m files and double clicking an album cover in the grid view will start playing that album. Lastly, album art in the grid view is now displayed more crisply on HiDPI displays.
The Videos app in Hera now supports automatically queuing up episodes when watching shows. It has also been updated to show audio track titles, i.e. with the language name. Keyboard navigation has been improved, and itâs now easier to clear playlist queue with a dedicated button.
Files in Hera received a major new feature: CloudProviders support. This means file syncing and cloud storage providers like NextCloud can use this standardized API and hook directly into the Files app, without having to do anything special for elementary OS. This API is also planned to be implemented in GNOME Files, and we hope to see it adopted more widely across FreeDesktops. Weâve also spent a ton of time improving Files in Hera.
Keyboard shortcut discoverability, color tagging, and checkerboard thumbnail backgrounds in Files
Weâve made search more discoverable by showing the search icon and placeholder text in the Home folder, similar to a web browserâs empty state. The search results dropdown is also larger and shows more results, and thereâs a new feature to hide thumbnails. âCherry pickingâ files has been greatly improved, and weâve refined the design of the color tags to be easier targetsâplus we show all color tags used in a selection in the context menu. We also now draw a checkerboard background behind transparent image thumbnails, making them easier to see.
System Settings
Improved keyboard shortcut discoverability in Code
Code has been updated for Hera with more discoverable keyboard shortcuts, the restoration of the line wrap setting, new âChange Branchâ functionality for git projects, and the display of hidden and non-text files in the sidebar to make git management more accurately reflect the state of the repository. Weâve also implemented several fixes and performance improvements, especially around saving and restoring files.
Lastly, weâve updated Terminal with a few small but welcome improvements.
And Moreâ¦
Weâve been steadily improving the core desktop experience in elementary OS Hera.
Picture-in-Picture now displays at the bottom-right of the display by default, better matching where users expected it. Weâve made several usability and performance improvements to taking screenshots. And weâve addressed a couple of visual glitches that sometimes occurred when tiling windows and on HiDPI displays after switching the scaling factor.
Weâve also brought several improvements to the top Panel and Indicators to Hera.
The Date & Time indicator has been redesigned with more clear navigation, dots on days with events, a more clear indication of the selected day, and a new side pane with the selected dayâs events.
Following our OS-wide efforts to progressively disclose keyboard shortcuts, the Session indicator now shows keyboard shortcuts for lock and log out.
We also improved several aspects of the Sound indicator including smooth scrolling, touchpad scrolling, and scroll directions, plus new features for microphone users like scrolling or middle-clicking the mic icon on the panel to adjust or mute input.
And a lot of little things: the Applications Menu now shows all configured keyboard shortcuts in its tooltip and is a bit faster, we added a new âView in AppCenterâ item to appsâ context menus in the Applications Menu, weâve improved the design of the Bluetooth indicator to be more consistent with other indicators and added connection status badge to each device, we fixed some minor visual inconsistencies in the Notifications indicator, and all indicators have been better translated into more languages.
Visual Style
Weâve improved the system stylesheet in several ways for Hera. To make certain situations like photo and video editing apps easier for color-correction, dark-styled apps in elementary OS now sport a dark color-neutral shade of gray instead of the previous cool-tinted gray.
Weâve added a subtle fade-out effect to the start and end of lists in popovers, like the list of Wi-Fi networks in the Networking indicator, or users in the Session indicator.
Soft fade in popover lists
Weâre styling Keycaps in menus now with a flatter style, which will come into play as we add keycaps in menus in future updates.
Keycaps in both light and dark menus
Progress and loading states on entries (like the address bar of browsers when a page is loading) have been made more subtle.
More subtle badges in sidebars
June updates story
July updates
Weâve also added icons for playlists, chat, caps lock, num lock, mail actions, SSDs, and headsets. Weâve refined and added several new sizes for icons for pixel-perfect hinting in more contextsâincluding the Onboarding experience. We also added symbolic versions of several icons including location services, laptops, and firmware. Weâve animated the microphone mute icon in the Panel, the mobile phone icons have been updated to better match modern phones, path and group icons (for drawing/design apps) have been redesigned, weâve added a few mirrored icons for right-to-left languages, and weâve made several icon families a bit more consistent.
Lastly, weâve updated the wallpapers. Three new photos join the set: snowy granite mountain ridges, a black and white pair of birds flying over a hill, and an interesting top-down view of brilliant blue water breaking on a beach. The default wallpaper has also been updated; this photo of a sunset over a pier was included in Juno, but weâve set it as the new default to give Hera its own unique identity. At the same time, the color scheme is similar to Juno with its purples, oranges and bluesâevoking the more iterative relationship between the two releases.
Under the Hood
An issue causing delayed shut downs in Juno was found and fixed for Hera. Apps installed as Snaps now properly show in Startup Apps settings. Flatpak is now included out of the box.
Along with all of the functional updates, translations, and issue fixes comes the latest hardware enablement provided by Linux 5.0 and the long-term support (LTS) hardware enablement (HWE) stack from Canonical. This includes improved support for more recent processors, GPUs, input devices, and more. Weâd like to give special thanks to the Ubuntu kernel and foundations teams for the work making this possible!
users of elementary OS 5 Juno get the update to 5.1 Hera alongside regular system updates
System Settings
The one exception is the LTS HWE stack; if youâre on an existing Juno install and would like or need the improved hardware support, you can install it from Terminal with the following command:
sudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-18.04 xserver-xorg-hwe-18.04
