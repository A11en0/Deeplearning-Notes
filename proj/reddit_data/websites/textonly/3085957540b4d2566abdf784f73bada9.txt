latest release
sudo dpkg -i dragonfire_1.0.4_amd64.deb
or clone the GitHub repository and run
sudo make install
in the repository directory.
sudo apt-get -f install
/usr/share/dragonfire/deepspeech/models
download the model
If you want to run Dragonfire on a server, you should install the Docker image (which does not install the huge
DeepSpeech model required for speech recognition):
docker pull dragoncomputer/dragonfire
usage: dragonfire [-h] [-c] [-s] [-j] [-v] [-g] [--server API_KEY] [-p PORT]
                  [--version]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c, --cli             Command-line interface mode. Give commands to
                        Dragonfire via command-line inputs (keyboard) instead
                        of audio inputs (microphone).
  -s, --silent          Silent mode. Disable Text-to-Speech output. Dragonfire
                        won't generate any audio output.
  -j, --headless        Headless mode. Do not display an avatar animation on
                        the screen. Disable the female head model.
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity of log output.
  -g, --gspeech         Instead of using the default speech recognition
                        method(Mozilla DeepSpeech), use Google Speech
                        Recognition service. (more accurate results)
  --server API_KEY      Server mode. Disable any audio functionality, serve a
                        RESTful spaCy API and become a Twitter integrated
                        chatbot.
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Port number for server mode.
  --version             Display the version number of Dragonfire.

docker run dragonfire [-h] [-c] [-s] [-j] [-v] [-g] [--server API_KEY] [-p PORT]
or simply start from your Linux application launcher.
