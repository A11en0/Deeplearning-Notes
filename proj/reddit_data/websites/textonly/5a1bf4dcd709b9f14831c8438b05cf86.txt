Exe colors and colors table mod
Dec 4, 2019
(Tested only on Linux)
This is a directory/file listing tool.
Similar to what ls and tree do, except it doesn't have all of their features.
It has different modes to list the contents of a directory.
Most item styles are customizable, you can set for instance that directories should be "bright red" in the config file.
Click here to see all available flags
This is how it normally looks.
Items are separated in Directories, Files, and Executables.
Symlinks are underlined.
Executables are bold.
This is a preset that turns on certain options to make it look like this.
It enables --fluid, meaning files, directories, are not in their own block.
Also removes titles with --no-titles.
This is a preset that turns on certain options to make it look like this.
It enables --fluid, --mix, and --no-titles.
--mix means sort everything in a single list, disregarding type.
Show items in a vertical list.
Categorize results by letters.
This shows directory content in a tree view:
Show previews of text files.
--snippets-length
You can use regex to filter results.
Just add re: to the filter.
Of course you can just use a non regex string to do so.
Here's using:
--permissions
Sorting is also possible. Either by size or modification date.
--sizesort (-i)
--datesort (-d)
In Linux a config is placed in ~/config/lq/lq.conf
It uses the TOML format.
Right now it has sections to exclude paths
and to change the color theme.
It looks like this:
exclude = [
  ".git",
  ".svn",
  "node_modules"
]

Excluding files affects modes like --tree
It can be specified multiple times.
i.e myprogram --exclude=bigDir -e=.git -e=target
It is checked as:
full_path.contains(&"/{e}/")

So if ".git" is excluded then
and not show its content in the tree view.
It's possible to override the default colors using the config file.
